This program is used to allow up to six teams to buzz-in and interact during games or lessons. After a team buzzes in, the program will stop listening for additional buzz-ins until the spacebar is pressed.

Teams are each assigned a series of keyboard keys, the pressing of which will register as a buzz-in:

Team 1: a-d
Team 2: e-h
Team 3: i-l
Team 4: m-p
Team 5: q-t
Team 6: u-x

This program is designed to be used with buzz-in hardware. A sample is shown in the picture (TeamBuzzersSetup.png) in this directory. The circuit is pulled from a cheap keyboard; large, colorful buttons are wired to press keys on the "keyboard" chip, which are then fed to the computer through the USB connection.
